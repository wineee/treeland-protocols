## Breaking changes

Breaking changes are grouped by version. Under each version heading, one subsection per affected protocol explains what changed, what replaces it, and how existing consumers should adapt.

### 0.7.0

#### `treeland-virtual-output-manager-v1.xml`

Superseded by `treeland-output-mirror-manager-unstable-v1.xml`; the old v1 file moved to `deprecated/` unchanged. The protocol was redesigned around `wl_output` object identity instead of output-name strings, with explicit source/mirror separation, a registry-pattern enumeration model, and fully specified object lifecycles. Wire-level differences:

1. Protocol and interfaces renamed: `treeland_virtual_output_manager_v1` → `treeland_output_mirror_manager_unstable_v1`, with interfaces `treeland_virtual_output_manager_v1` → `treeland_output_mirror_manager_v1` and `treeland_virtual_output_v1` → `treeland_output_mirror_group_v1`; interface versions reset to 1.
2. Output identity switched from names to objects: the `name` and `outputs` `string`/`array` arguments of `create_virtual_output`, the `names` `array` argument of the `virtual_output_list` event, and the `outputs` `array` argument of the `outputs` event are all removed. The new `create_group` request takes only a group `name` `string`; outputs are referenced by `wl_output` objects on the group's `set_source`, `add_output`, and `remove_output` requests and on its `source`, `output_added`, and `output_removed` events. The old `outputs[0] = source, outputs[1..] = mirrors` positional convention is replaced by an explicit `set_source` request and an ordered `add_output`/`remove_output` mirror list, with the nullable `source` event reporting the current source.
3. Enumeration replaced by a registry push model: the `get_virtual_output_list` request and the `virtual_output_list` snapshot event are removed. On binding the manager the compositor emits one `group_added` event (carrying a fresh group object) per existing group, and again whenever a group is created; `group_removed` is emitted when a group is dissolved. This removes the list-then-lookup TOCTOU window.
4. The `get_virtual_output` request is removed; clients obtain handles to existing groups from the bind-time `group_added` dump or from later `group_added` events, so the unknown-name fatal-error path no longer exists.
5. The per-group `error` event is removed; validation failures are now fatal protocol errors posted with specific enum entries. Manager errors: `invalid_name` (empty, non-UTF-8, or NUL-containing name) and `name_exists` (duplicate). Group errors: `invalid_output` (null/disabled/destroyed output), `duplicate_output` (already a member of this group), `output_in_use` (member of another group), `not_in_group` (remove of a non-member), and `already_dissolved` (request after the group was dissolved). The old codes `invalid_group_name` (0), `invalid_screen_number` (1), and `invalid_output` (2) no longer exist.
6. Object lifecycle redefined: destroying a group object (`destroy`) now only releases that client's handle and does not dissolve the group or affect other clients; a separate `dissolve` request tears down the group, emitting `removed` to all bound group objects and `group_removed` on the manager. The old behavior, where any client destroying its `treeland_virtual_output_v1` object (including one obtained via `get_virtual_output`) dissolved the group, is removed. Initial state is now pushed: a `source` event (nullable) followed by one `output_added` per mirror is emitted immediately on every group object's creation, so clients no longer start with unknown state.
7. Source-successor behavior on hardware removal is retained and made explicit: when the source output is unplugged or disabled and mirrors remain, the first remaining mirror becomes the new source (the compositor emits `output_removed` then `source` for it); client-driven `remove_output` of the source instead clears it (emits `source` with null) and does not auto-select a successor.

Consumers should rebind the global as `treeland_output_mirror_manager_v1`, obtain `treeland_output_mirror_group_v1` objects from the `group_added` event (or as the return value of `create_group`), reference outputs as `wl_output` objects via `set_source`/`add_output`/`remove_output`, and dissolve groups with `dissolve` rather than by destroying a group object; the old v1 XML is kept installed during migration but must not be used in new code.

### 0.6.0

#### `treeland-output-manager-v1.xml`

Superseded by `treeland-output-manager-unstable-v2.xml`; the old v1 file moved to `deprecated/` unchanged. The v2 protocol renames both interfaces, normalizes member ordering, and switches primary-output identification from output names to `wl_output` objects. Wire-level differences:

1. Interfaces renamed: `treeland_output_manager_v1` → `treeland_output_manager_v2` and `treeland_output_color_control_v1` → `treeland_output_picture_control_v2`; interface versions reset to 1 and the `since="2"` markers were removed.
2. `destroy` moved to the first request on both interfaces, shifting the opcodes of all other requests by one.
3. `set_primary_output` now takes a non-null, enabled `wl_output` object instead of an output name `string`; passing a disabled or destroyed output is rejected via a `primary_output_failed` event rather than a protocol error. The compositor no longer supports clearing the primary designation via a null argument.
4. The `primary_output` event now carries a `wl_output` object (null only when no output is available) instead of an output name `string`, is emitted once immediately after bind, and confirms every `set_primary_output` request. When the designated primary output is disconnected or disabled, the compositor automatically selects another available output as the new primary and emits this event.
5. The `result` event argument changed from a plain `uint` flag (1 = success, 0 = failure) to the new `commit_result` enum (`success = 0`, `failed = 1`, `unsupported = 2`, `invalid_output = 3`), so the wire values are inverted.
6. The picture control `error` enum is retained on the renamed `treeland_output_picture_control_v2` interface; its `invalid_color_temperature`/`invalid_brightness` entries keep the same names but their values reset from 1/2 to 0/1 following the interface version reset, and the fatal-protocol-error behavior on out-of-range `set_*` values is unchanged. `commit_result` therefore carries only success and output-related failure causes (no range entries); enums moved before requests, and a `primary_output_failed_reason` enum backs the new `primary_output_failed` event. `get_picture_control` accepts any valid `wl_output` regardless of state — invalid object ids remain a core protocol error; output validity is reported at commit time through the `result` event.

Consumers should rebind the global as `treeland_output_manager_v2`, pass `wl_output` objects instead of output names, and interpret `result` values via the `commit_result` enum; the old v1 XML is kept installed during migration but must not be used in new code.

#### `treeland-personalization-manager-v1.xml`

Superseded by `treeland-decoration-unstable-v1.xml` and `treeland-appearance-unstable-v1.xml` (in `public/`), and `treeland-appearance-manager-unstable-v1.xml` (in `dde/`); per-window background blur is handled by the upstream `ext-background-effect-v1` protocol. The old v1 file moved to `deprecated/` unchanged.

Key changes:
1. **Protocol split and role separation**:
   - Server-side decoration (SSD) customization (window corner radius, shadow, border, and server-side titlebar) is split into `treeland-decoration-unstable-v1.xml` (in `public/`). It requires xdg-decoration server-side decorations first and enables a "half-CSD, half-SSD" configuration (keep compositor border/corners/shadow while hiding its titlebar).
   - Per-window background blur is replaced by the upstream `ext-background-effect-v1` protocol (staging in wayland-protocols), which is decoration-mode independent and advertises its blur capability via the `capabilities` event. The `wallpaper` blend mode of the old protocol is deprecated without replacement; consumers must not rely on it.
   - Read-only user-level appearance querying and observation (cursor theme/size, fonts, icon theme, accent color, window opacity, color scheme, titlebar height, corner radius) is split into `treeland-appearance-unstable-v1.xml` (in `public/`) for all regular applications.
   - Privileged user-level appearance configuration (modifying cursor, fonts, and visual theming) is split into `treeland-appearance-manager-unstable-v1.xml` (in `dde/`) for desktop control center and system settings components.
2. **Push-model state synchronization**:
   - Removed redundant synchronous `get_*` query requests. The compositor pushes current values immediately upon context creation and broadcasts changes to all bound contexts.
3. **Cursor settings simplification**:
   - Removed `commit` request and `verfity` event. `set_theme` and `set_size` now take effect immediately, matching font and appearance context semantics.
4. **Color scheme enum renamed and refined**:
   - Renamed `theme_type` to `color_scheme` and removed `auto`, standardizing the enum to `light` (0) and `dark` (1); dynamic auto-switching policy is handled client-side.
5. **Standardized lifecycle and structure**:
   - Added explicit `type="destructor"` to `destroy` requests and moved them to the first request on each interface;
   - Placed all `enum` definitions before requests and all `event` definitions after requests.
6. **Numeric representation normalized (wire-incompatible)**:
   - `window_opacity`: the old `uint` value with no defined range is now a `fixed` value in `[0.0, 1.0]` (1.0 fully opaque, 0.0 fully transparent). Both the `set_window_opacity` request argument and the `window_opacity` event argument changed type and scale; consumers must switch from integer percentage handling to fixed-point.
   - `active_color`: the old single `string` argument (a color description) is now four `uint` components `r, g, b, a` in `[0, 255]`, on both the `set_accent_color` request and the `accent_color` event.

#### `treeland-window-management-v1.xml`

Superseded by `treeland-show-desktop-unstable-v1.xml`; the old v1 file moved to `deprecated/`. The protocol was renamed to reflect its actual scope (show-desktop mode only). Compared to the old `treeland_window_management_v1` interface:

1. The interface was renamed to `treeland_show_desktop_v1`.
2. The `destroy` request was moved to the first request position.
3. The `show_desktop` event was renamed to `show_desktop_state`.
4. The `desktop_state` enum was renamed to `state`.
5. The `preview_show` enum entry was removed because it was never implemented and is no longer needed.
6. The `set_desktop` request was renamed to `set_show_desktop_state`.
7. The description was corrected and expanded.

Consumers should rebind the global as `treeland_show_desktop_v1`, send `set_show_desktop_state` to request a transition, and listen for `show_desktop_state` to observe compositor-driven changes; the old v1 XML is kept installed during migration but must not be used in new code.

#### `treeland-foreign-toplevel-manager-v1.xml`

Superseded by `treeland-foreign-toplevel-manager-unstable-v2.xml`; the old v1 file moved to `deprecated/`. The protocol was redesigned with corrected naming, member ordering, and improved descriptions. Compared to the old `treeland_foreign_toplevel_manager_v1` interface:

1. Naming corrected: `unstable` added to the file and protocol name; the three interfaces were bumped to `_v2`.
2. A `destroy` destructor request is now the first request on all three interfaces (newly added on the manager, moved to first on the other two).
3. Enums were moved before requests.
4. Events were moved after requests.
5. The `finished` event was changed from a destructor event to a plain event, and the `stop` request no longer forbids all further requests. The compositor no longer destroys the manager object automatically; the client must send `destroy` explicitly, ideally after `stop` and `finished`.
6. The `set_rectangle` request was renamed to `set_icon_geometry`, and the `invalid_rectangle` error entry was renamed to `invalid_geometry`.
7. The dock preview `show` request's `surfaces` argument was renamed to `identifiers` to reflect that it carries uint32 toplevel identifiers, not wl_surface objects.
8. A manager `error` enum was added with `invalid_surface`, raised when the `relative_surface` passed to `get_dock_preview_context` is not a valid wl_surface owned by the calling client.
9. The description was corrected and expanded.

Consumers should rebind the global as `treeland_foreign_toplevel_manager_v2`, obtain `treeland_foreign_toplevel_handle_v2` objects from the `toplevel` event, and use `treeland_dock_preview_context_v2` for previews; the old v1 XML is kept installed during migration but must not be used in new code.
#### `treeland-shortcut-manager-v2.xml`

Superseded by `treeland-shortcut-manager-unstable-v3.xml`; the old v2 file moved to `deprecated/` unchanged. The protocol was renamed to follow the unstable naming convention, and the interfaces were renamed to match the new major version. Compared to the old `treeland_shortcut_manager_v2` interface:

1. The protocol was renamed to `treeland_shortcut_manager_unstable_v3`; the interfaces were renamed to `treeland_shortcut_manager_v3` and `treeland_shortcut_capture_v3`.
2. The manager interface version was reset from 3 to 1 and all `since` attributes were removed (they marked members added across v2 interface versions 2 and 3: `capture_next_shortcut`, the `invalid_surface` error, and the `tile_left`/`tile_right` actions).
3. The `action` enum was restructured and renumbered: `quit` and `taskswitch_enter` were removed (`quit` is no longer exposed as a shortcut; the task switcher is entered implicitly by the `taskswitch_next`/`taskswitch_prev` actions); the direct-switch set was expanded from `workspace_1`..`workspace_6` to `workspace_1`..`workspace_12`; and 14 new actions were added — `minimize`, `resize_window`, `move_window_to_prev_workspace`, `move_window_to_next_workspace`, `zoom_in`/`zoom_out`/`zoom_reset`, and the tiling snap family `tile_top`/`tile_bottom`/`tile_top_left`/`tile_top_right`/`tile_bottom_left`/`tile_bottom_right`. Entries were regrouped into logical families (notify, workspace switching, window state, window operations, cross-workspace move, show-desktop/multitask, task switching, tiling, screen zoom, system), so every action value changed; `notify` is now 0 and `shutdown_menu` is now 45. Some newly added actions may not yet be implemented by every compositor build; binding such an action is accepted but has no effect until implemented.
4. The commit mechanism was removed: `bind_key`, `bind_swipe_gesture`, and `bind_hold_gesture` take effect immediately, a rejected bind is reported per binding via the new `bind_failure` event, and the `commit` request, the `commit_success` and `commit_failure` events, and the `error.invalid_commit` entry no longer exist. The `error.invalid_surface` entry was renumbered from 4 to 3. Unlike the old model, one failing binding no longer rolls back the other bindings of the same batch.
5. Documentation was refined (no wire change): destroying the manager object is now documented to implicitly release the exclusive control acquired via `acquire`, and the `capture_next_shortcut` request and the capture interface semantics were rewritten to match the compositor implementation (trigger timing, seat/focus validation, the `busy`/`aborted` failure conditions, and the valid-shortcut rules).

Consumers should rebind the global as `treeland_shortcut_manager_v3`, send `acquire` before any bind or unbind request, and create capture objects via `capture_next_shortcut`; the old v2 XML is kept installed during migration but must not be used in new code.
